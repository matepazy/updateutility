# UpdateUtility

### Usage
1. Replace the `version_url` and `exe_base_url` with your own. *(it's recommended to use github)*
2. Make sure that the installation wizzard creates a `version.txt` file, or integrate it into your application. `version.txt` is used to determine the local version.
3. Replace `MyApp` with your app's name. *(optional)*

### Installation
Install the necessary modules:
```pip
pip install requests customtkinter psutil
```
